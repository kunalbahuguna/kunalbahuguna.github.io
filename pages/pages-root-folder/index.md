# Use the call for action to show a button on the frontpage
#
# To make internal links, just use a permalink like this

#
# To style the button in different colors, use no value
# to use the main color or success, alert or secondary.
# To change colors see sass/_01_settings_colors.scss

# About Me   {#about}

I am Ph.D student working under supervision of Prof. S.V. Raghurama Rao in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at Indian Institute of Science. My PhD work is primarily focused on developing numerical schemes for compressible fluid flow equations. I specifically work on structure preserving finite volume schemes for the Euler equations. I am also interested in heuristic optimization algorithms and their applications to aerodynamic shape optimization problems.
