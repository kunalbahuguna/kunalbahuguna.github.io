## Research Interests   {#research-interests}

My research interests are primarily in algorithm development for computational fluid dynamics. I have worked on structure (entropy/kinetic energy) preserving schemes for hyperbolic systems such as compressible Euler and Multicomponent flows. I am also interested in optimization methods and aerodynamic shape optimizations.
