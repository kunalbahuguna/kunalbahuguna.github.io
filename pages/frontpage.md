## [2-D Navier-Stokes Code](https://github.com/kunalbahuguna/Finite_Volume_2D_Solver) (*currently private*)
A Viscous Euler code which can work on both structured and unstructured grids. Second order FV schemes are implemented using linear reconstruction in space and higher order SSPRK time stepping. Numerous test cases are added for validation. Code is written in C++ and parallelized using OpenMP.

## [2-D Multicomponent Euler Code](https://github.com/kunalbahuguna/MultiComponent_Euler2D_Solver) (*currently private*)
A two-component Euler code (based on 2-D Navier-Stokes Code) with conservative and the gamma model of equations. 

## [Particle Swarm Optimizer](https://github.com/kunalbahuguna/Particle_Swarm_Optimizer)
A code written in C++ with three different PSO variants. More details on the github page.

## [Lid Driven Cavity Finite Difference Code](https://github.com/kunalbahuguna/Lid_Driven_Cavity_Codes)
A MATLAB implementation of incompressible viscous Navier-Stokes equations on a staggered grid for lid driven cavity problem.
